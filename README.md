## Disclaimer

Hey there, I'd like to start by saying that I created this repository as a resource for those who are new to Python and want to learn it for Cloud Computing or DevOps career. However, I'd like to emphasise that using you cannot become a Python expert in 7 days, and this repository does not automatically turn you into a Python expert. It is only a starting point for you to gain a basic understanding of the language and some related concepts. Python is a vast and ever-changing language, and becoming an expert takes time and practise. I hope this disclaimer clears up any misunderstandings and assists you in approaching this resource with realistic expectations. Happy studying!
